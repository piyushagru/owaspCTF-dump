Where's Wally?
There's just not enough there to suggest that this question would last much longer than 15 minutes, and the show doesn't help by having all of its characters agree. This isn't an question. This isn't marketing. This is reality! Waldo is my life Waldo is everything! I love my blue digital animal but now he is lost. <br><h3>Please find it for me!</h3>
