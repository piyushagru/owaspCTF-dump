Another One Bites the Dust
The film was a huge success!! I even wanted to include music I was working on for another project, but despite my desperate efforts they wouldn't let me. Those buffoons don't realise that we are in a connected world. I'll send my music out. They can't stop me on the internet. Here, I am just anonymous. I am just alone.

Listen to my music track. Those production houses will never know the secrets I let out in the track. A single tool is all takes to retrieve those secrets.
Can you find any recent reference with the music track name or the message. The word of importance was a lot in the past news and currently it's hype is again revived. ANY TECHNIQUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD?
